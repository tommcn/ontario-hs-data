# Exploring Ontario High School Open Data

This project explores Ontario data, and focuses on High School performance in Math and Literacy (as measured by the OSSLT).

The data is taken from [Data Ontario](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/school-information-and-student-demographics/resource/e0e90bd5-d662-401a-a6d2-60d69ac89d14), and is current as of 2025.

The data can be easily searched by municipality, and the dashboard presents the user with a table and interactive map of the schools in the municipality, and some quick facts about the high schools in the region.
